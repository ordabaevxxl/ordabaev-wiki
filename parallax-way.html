	<h2>Our Vision</h2>
		<p>We envision a world that works well. Where many disparate parts come together with energy, synergy, and synchronicity to form a more valuable, more connected, more innovative, and more rewarding whole.<br>
		We believe that, while we can't create perfection, we can strive for it. While we can't make others accept new ideas, new processes, and new results, we can make it possible for people to see the benefits with greater clarity.<br>
		We work, every day, toward making our vision a reality by never forgetting what it is, by keeping our mission and our values central to our core beliefs and work, and by remaining positive that we live in a world where ideas and people can, should, and must make a difference.</p>
	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>Our mission is to change the world, and to help our clients change it. That's why "Change the world." is the default screen saver on Parallax computers. Why it's the large sculpture in the entryway of each of our offices. And why it's the theme line we use in all of our communications.<br>
		We know change is the new constant; it's all around us and dealing with it is challenging. We therefore strive to make it easier for our clients, partners and workforce to learn how to use various perspectives in observing, understanding and addressing it. Our way is not the only way. We recognize and respect different approaches to the same challenge.</p>

		<h2>Our Values</h2>
		<p>We accomplish our mission and fulfill our vision by adhering to our core values:</p>
		<ul>
			<img src="images\Team.jpg" class="floatRightImg" alt="The Parallax Team">
			<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> We adhere to the highest ethical standards: honesty and fairness are the foundations of our actions. We take pride in our honest dealing with others irrespective of nationality, culture or belief.</li>
			<li><strong>Respect:</strong> We respect the rights, beliefs, and differences of our colleagues, our clients, our partners, and other citizens of the world. We treat others with care, dignity, equality and trust.</li>
			<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> We meet or exceed our commitments, and take responsibility for our performance in all of our decisions and actions. We remain accountable to our highest standards and to those who expect the best from us and who provide us with business.</li>
			<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We constantly look for and develop new ways to deliver value to our clients, our partners, and our global community. We look to the horizon and anticipate what new problems are coming, and what new solutions can be developed to meet them. We innovate in thought, in action and in finding ways to do things more effectively, more efficiently and more productively.</li>
			<li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> We work together in diverse and unified teams, at every level of the organization. We do that because we believe that teamwork is what makes us stronger. We help each other and by doing that help ourselves be better, stronger and united.</li>
